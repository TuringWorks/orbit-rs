# Kubernetes Container Pipeline Fix - Summary

## Overview
This PR fixes the Kubernetes Container Pipeline that was failing with multiple critical issues preventing container image builds from succeeding.

## Problem Statement
The workflow run [#47](https://github.com/TuringWorks/orbit-rs/actions/runs/18416529664) failed with the following errors:
1. Invalid Docker image tag format (uppercase repository name)
2. Attempted to build containers for library crates without binary targets
3. ARM64 cross-compilation failures due to missing OpenSSL configuration
4. Protected branch push violations when deploying GitHub Pages

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Uppercase Repository Name in Image Tags
**Error**: `invalid reference format: repository name must be lowercase`

**Root Cause**: The workflow used `${{ github.repository_owner }}/orbit-rs` which evaluates to `TuringWorks/orbit-rs` with uppercase letters. Docker/Podman strictly requires lowercase repository names.

**Impact**: All image builds failed immediately during the tag creation phase.

### 2. Building Library Crates as Containers
**Error**: `no bin target named 'orbit-client' in 'orbit-client' package`

**Root Cause**: The build matrix included `orbit-client` and `orbit-compute`, which are library crates without `[[bin]]` sections in their Cargo.toml files. Only `orbit-server` and `orbit-operator` have binary targets.

**Impact**: Build jobs failed when attempting to build non-existent binaries.

### 3. Missing OpenSSL Configuration for ARM64
**Error**: `Could not find directory of OpenSSL installation`

**Root Cause**: Cross-compiling Rust crates with OpenSSL dependencies for ARM64 requires explicit environment variables pointing to the cross-compilation toolchain's OpenSSL installation.

**Impact**: ARM64 builds failed during the Cargo build step.

### 4. Protected Branch Push Violation
**Error**: `GH006: Protected branch update failed for refs/heads/main`

**Root Cause**: The "Generate Container Images Download Page" job attempted to commit and push directly to the protected `main` branch.

**Impact**: The final job in the workflow failed, preventing Pages deployment.

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Hardcoded Lowercase Repository Name
```yaml
# Before
IMAGE_NAMESPACE: ${{ github.repository_owner }}/orbit-rs

# After
IMAGE_NAMESPACE: turingworks/orbit-rs
```

**Why**: Hardcoding ensures the repository name is always lowercase regardless of the GitHub organization's capitalization.

### Fix 2: Removed Library Crates from Build Matrix
```yaml
# Before
component: ["orbit-server", "orbit-client", "orbit-operator", "orbit-compute"]

# After
component: ["orbit-server", "orbit-operator"]
```

**Why**: Only components with binary targets can be built into standalone executables for containerization.

### Fix 3: Added OpenSSL Environment Variables
```yaml
- name: Install cross-compilation tools
  if: matrix.platform == 'linux/arm64'
  run: |
    sudo apt-get install -y gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu libssl-dev:arm64 || true
    echo "CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_LINKER=aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    echo "OPENSSL_DIR=/usr" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    echo "OPENSSL_LIB_DIR=/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    echo "OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    echo "PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_CROSS=1" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

**Why**: The `openssl-sys` crate needs explicit paths when cross-compiling to find the correct architecture's OpenSSL libraries.

### Fix 4: Removed Direct Branch Push
```yaml
# Before
- name: Commit and push download page
  run: |
    git commit -m "Update container images download page [skip ci]"
    git push

# After
- name: Stage download page for Pages deployment
  run: |
    echo "Download page generated at docs/container-images/index.html"
```

**Why**: GitHub Pages deployment via `actions/deploy-pages@v4` uses artifacts, not direct repository pushes. This avoids protected branch conflicts.

## Additional Improvements

### Simplified GPU Builds
Removed GPU-enabled build variants (`gpu-enabled: [false]`) to simplify the initial implementation. GPU support can be added back when needed.

### Consistent Component Updates
Updated all workflow jobs to use the reduced component list:
- `create-manifests` job
- `validate-k8s-deployment` job
- Success notification messages

## Validation

Created `scripts/validate-workflow-fixes.sh` to verify all fixes:

```bash
✅ IMAGE_NAMESPACE is correctly lowercase
✅ Build matrix correctly includes only orbit-server and orbit-operator
✅ OpenSSL environment variables configured for ARM64
✅ Pages deployment correctly uses artifacts, no git push
✅ orbit-server has binary target
✅ orbit-operator has binary target
✅ Manifest creation job matches build matrix
```

## Expected Results

After merging this PR, the Kubernetes Container Pipeline should:

1. ✅ Successfully build container images with lowercase tags
   - `ghcr.io/turingworks/orbit-rs/orbit-server:*`
   - `ghcr.io/turingworks/orbit-rs/orbit-operator:*`

2. ✅ Build for both platforms
   - `linux/amd64`
   - `linux/arm64`

3. ✅ Create multi-platform manifests
   - Automatically select correct image based on host architecture

4. ✅ Deploy GitHub Pages without protected branch conflicts
   - Container images download page available at GitHub Pages URL

5. ✅ Pass all security scans
   - Trivy vulnerability scanning
   - SARIF reports uploaded

## Files Changed

- `.github/workflows/k8s-container-pipeline.yml` - Main workflow with all fixes
- `docs/wip/K8S_CONTAINER_PIPELINE_FIX.md` - Detailed technical documentation
- `scripts/validate-workflow-fixes.sh` - Validation script for verifying fixes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Merge and Monitor**: Watch the workflow run on the target branch
2. **Verify Images**: Check that images are pushed to `ghcr.io/turingworks/orbit-rs/`
3. **Test Pull**: Try pulling both platforms: `podman pull ghcr.io/turingworks/orbit-rs/orbit-server:latest-release --platform=linux/amd64`
4. **Validate Pages**: Check that the container images page deploys successfully
