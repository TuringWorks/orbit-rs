## What is Orbit-RS?

Orbit is a framework for building distributed systems using virtual actors. A virtual actor is an object that interacts with the world using asynchronous messages. Actors can be active or inactive - when inactive, their state resides in storage, and when a message is sent to an inactive actor, it automatically activates on an available server in the cluster.

### Key Features
- 🚀 **Virtual Actors**: Automatic lifecycle management with on-demand activation
- ⚡ **High Performance**: Up to 500k+ messages/second per core with Rust's memory safety
- 🏁 **Heterogeneous Compute**: **NEW!** Automatic hardware acceleration (CPU SIMD, GPU, Neural Engines) with 5-50x speedups for parallelizable workloads
- 💎 **Distributed Transactions**: ACID-compliant with 2-phase commit, saga patterns, and distributed locks
- 🔌 **Redis Protocol**: **✅ PRODUCTION-READY with 100% compatibility** - Full redis-cli support, 50+ commands, all data types working
- 🖾 **PostgreSQL Protocol**: Complete wire protocol with advanced SQL features and pgvector support
- 🤖 **AI Agent Integration**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) with comprehensive tool support for AI workflows
- 🤖 **AI/ML Ready**: Native vector similarity search, embeddings storage, and semantic search capabilities
- 📊 **Time Series**: Full RedisTimeSeries compatibility with aggregation, retention policies, and real-time analytics
- 🕸️ **Graph Database**: Cypher-like queries with execution planning, profiling, and distributed graph operations
- ☘️ **Kubernetes Native**: Custom operator with CRDs, Helm charts, and production-ready deployment
- 📊 **Observability**: Built-in Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, and comprehensive monitoring
- 🛡️ **Enterprise Security**: Authentication, authorization, audit logging, and compliance features

## Quick Start

### 🚀 Redis Server Quick Start

**Get a production-ready Redis server running in 30 seconds:**

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/TuringWorks/orbit-rs.git
cd orbit-rs
cargo build --release

# Start distributed Redis server (one command!)
./start-orbit-redis.sh

# Connect with any Redis client
redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6379
127.0.0.1:6379> set hello "world"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> get hello
"world"
127.0.0.1:6379> hset user:1 name "Alice" age "25"
(integer) 2
127.0.0.1:6379> hgetall user:1
1) "name"
2) "Alice"
3) "age"
4) "25"
```

**✨ Features**: All Redis data types, redis-cli compatibility, distributed actors, horizontal scaling

**📚 Complete Guide**: [RESP Production Guide](docs/protocols/RESP_PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md) - Setup, configuration, monitoring, troubleshooting

### Manual Installation
```bash
cargo build --release
cargo test
```

### Basic Actor Example
```rust
use orbit_client::OrbitClient;
use orbit_shared::{ActorWithStringKey, Key};
use async_trait::async_trait;

#[async_trait]
trait GreeterActor: ActorWithStringKey {
    async fn greet(&self, name: String) -> Result<String, orbit_shared::OrbitError>;
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let client = OrbitClient::builder().with_namespace("demo").build().await?;
    let greeter = client.actor_reference::<dyn GreeterActor>(
        Key::StringKey { key: "my-greeter".to_string() }
    ).await?;
    
    let greeting = greeter.greet("World".to_string()).await?;
    println!("{}", greeting); // "Hello, World!"
    Ok(())
}
```
