## 🏗️ Current Project Status

### Build Status: ✅ PASSING (Updated)
```bash
$ cargo check --workspace
# All modules compile successfully including persistence backends
# Fixed all compilation errors in persistence modules

$ cargo test --lib --package orbit-server
# 16 tests passing in orbit-server (persistence modules working)
test result: ok. 16 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored
