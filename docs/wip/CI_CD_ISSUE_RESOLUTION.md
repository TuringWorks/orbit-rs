# CI/CD Pipeline Failure - Issue Resolution

**Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Issue:** CI/CD Pipeline Failure (Run #65, Commit 7e9a268)  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED (Historical Issue)

## Issue Summary

The CI/CD pipeline run #65 failed on October 3, 2025 at commit `7e9a268f2d65edcba46c45c62e3da8a13a9bbfa7` with the following error:

```
Error writing files: failed to resolve mod `core`: 
/home/runner/work/orbit-rs/orbit-rs/orbit-shared/src/transactions/core.rs does not exist
```

**Workflow:** CI/CD Pipeline (later renamed to "Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline")  
**Branch:** refs/heads/main  
**Author:** @ravituringworks  
**Event:** push

## Root Cause Analysis

The file `orbit-shared/src/transactions/core.rs` was missing from the repository at the time of the failure. This was caused by a `.gitignore` pattern that was too broad:

### Original `.gitignore` Pattern (Line 175)
```gitignore
# Core dumps
core.*
```

**Problem:** This pattern was intended to ignore core dump files (which are created when programs crash), but it also matched:
- `core.rs` (Rust source files)
- `core.toml` (configuration files)
- `core.json` (data files)
- Any file starting with `core.`

### Detection Process

1. ✅ Verified file exists locally but not in git
2. ✅ Checked git tracking: `git ls-files orbit-shared/src/transactions/core.rs` (empty output)
3. ✅ Identified the issue: `git check-ignore -v orbit-shared/src/transactions/core.rs`
   ```
   .gitignore:175:core.*   orbit-shared/src/transactions/core.rs
   ```

## Resolution Implemented (Historical)

The issue was already fixed in subsequent commits between October 3rd and the current main branch:

### Fix #1: Update `.gitignore` Pattern

**Changed to:**
```gitignore
# Core dumps (but not core.rs source files)
core
core.[0-9]*
```

**Rationale:**
- `core` - Ignores the core dump file without extension
- `core.[0-9]*` - Ignores numbered core dumps like `core.1234`, `core.5678`
- Does NOT match `core.rs` (which has alphabetic characters after the dot)

### Fix #2: Add `core.rs` to Repository

The file was force-added to the repository:
```bash
git add -f orbit-shared/src/transactions/core.rs
```

### Fix #3: Update Workflow Cache Key

The GitHub Actions cache key was updated to include versioning:
```yaml
key: ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-v3-${{ hashFiles('**/Cargo.lock') }}
```

This ensures stale caches don't cause issues with missing files.

## Current Status Verification (2025-10-11)

### File Status
- ✅ `core.rs` exists on current main branch (commit b97f966)
- ✅ File is tracked in git: `git ls-files orbit-shared/src/transactions/core.rs`
- ✅ File is not ignored: `git check-ignore -v orbit-shared/src/transactions/core.rs` (empty)
- ✅ `.gitignore` pattern correctly updated

### Build Status
- ✅ `cargo fmt --all -- --check` passes
- ✅ `orbit-shared` builds successfully
- ✅ 263 tests pass in `orbit-shared`

### Additional Fixes Applied
Applied code formatting fixes to meet current CI/CD standards:
- `orbit-ml/src/engine/mod.rs` - Removed trailing whitespace
- `orbit-shared/src/orbitql/distributed_execution.rs` - Fixed import ordering
- `orbit-shared/src/orbitql/query_cache.rs` - Fixed import ordering

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Be Careful with Broad `.gitignore` Patterns

**Problem:** The pattern `core.*` was too broad

**Best Practice:**
- ✅ Use specific patterns like `core` and `core.[0-9]*`
- ✅ Test patterns before committing: `git check-ignore -v <file>`
- ❌ Avoid broad patterns like `core.*` that may match source files

### 2. Verify Files are Tracked

Before pushing important source files:
```bash
# Check if file is tracked
git ls-files <file>

# Check if file is ignored
git check-ignore -v <file>

# List all ignored files
git status --ignored
```

### 3. GitHub Actions Cache Considerations

- Cache invalidation issues can cause "file not found" errors
- Use versioned cache keys for manual control
- Document cache strategy in workflow files

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Pre-commit Checks

Add to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: check-ignored-source-files
      name: Check for ignored source files
      entry: sh -c 'git ls-files -o -i --exclude-standard | grep "\\.rs$" && exit 1 || exit 0'
      language: system
```

### 2. CI/CD Validation

Add to workflow:
```yaml
- name: Verify source files are tracked
  run: |
    IGNORED_RS=$(git ls-files -o -i --exclude-standard | grep '\.rs$' || true)
    if [ -n "$IGNORED_RS" ]; then
      echo "Error: Source files are being ignored: $IGNORED_RS"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### 3. Regular `.gitignore` Audits

Periodically review patterns to ensure they're not too broad.
