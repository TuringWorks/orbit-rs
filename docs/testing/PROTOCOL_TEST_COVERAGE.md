## Overall Production Readiness

### Summary Statistics

| Protocol | Tests Implemented | Tests Planned | Coverage | Status |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|----------|--------|
| PostgreSQL | 3 | 79 | 3.8% |  PARTIAL |
| MySQL | 0 | 50 | 0% | ⏭  PLANNED |
| CQL | 0 | 40 | 0% | ⏭  PLANNED |
| Redis | 2 | 35 | 5.7% |  PARTIAL |
| OrbitQL | 2 | 8 | 25% |  PARTIAL |
| AQL | 0 | 30 | 0% | ⏭  PLANNED |
| Cypher | 1 | 10 | 10% |  PARTIAL |
| **TOTAL** | **8** | **252** | **3.2%** | ** EARLY STAGE** |

### Production Readiness Assessment

**Current Status: NOT PRODUCTION READY** 

#### Critical Gaps

1. **PostgreSQL** - Needs 76 more tests (critical for SQL compatibility)
   -  DDL operations (CREATE, ALTER, DROP)
   -  Complex DQL (JOINs, subqueries, CTEs)
   -  Transactions (ACID guarantees)
   -  pgvector operations (critical for AI workloads)

2. **MySQL** - Needs full test suite (50 tests)
   -  All operations untested

3. **CQL** - Needs full test suite (40 tests)
   -  All operations untested

4. **Redis** - Needs 33 more tests
   -  Hash, List, Set, Sorted Set operations
   -  Pub/Sub, expiration, persistence

5. **OrbitQL** - Needs 6 more tests
   -  Multi-model queries
   -  Time travel features
   -  Graph operations

6. **AQL** - Needs full test suite (30 tests)
   -  All operations untested

7. **Cypher** - Needs 9 more tests
   -  Relationship creation/matching
   -  Path traversal

#### Recommended Test Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (Critical - Next 2 weeks):**
- PostgreSQL: DDL, basic DML, transactions (20 tests)
- Redis: String, Hash, List operations (15 tests)
- OrbitQL: Multi-model, time travel (5 tests)

**Phase 2 (Important - 2-4 weeks):**
- PostgreSQL: Complex queries, aggregates, pgvector (30 tests)
- MySQL: Core SQL operations (25 tests)
- Cypher: Graph operations (8 tests)

**Phase 3 (Enhancement - 1-2 months):**
- CQL: Full test suite (40 tests)
- AQL: Full test suite (30 tests)
- PostgreSQL: Window functions, advanced features (26 tests)
- Redis: Advanced features (18 tests)

#### Estimated Timeline to Production Ready

- **Minimum Viable (50% coverage):** 1-2 months
- **Production Ready (80% coverage):** 3-4 months
- **Comprehensive (95% coverage):** 4-6 months

## Test Implementation Guide

### Running Disabled Tests

All disabled tests are marked with `#[ignore]`. To see what needs implementation:

```bash
# List all ignored tests
cargo test -- --ignored --list

# Try running ignored tests (will fail)
cargo test -- --ignored
```

### Implementing a Test

1. Find disabled test in appropriate file
2. Remove `#[ignore]` attribute
3. Implement test logic
4. Run: `cargo test <test_name>`
5. Fix until passing
6. Update this document

### Test Template

```rust
#[test]
fn test_feature_name() {
    // Setup
    let server = start_test_server();

    // Execute
    let result = server.execute("COMMAND");

    // Assert
    assert_eq!(result, expected);
}
```
