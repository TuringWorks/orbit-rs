# Kubernetes Container Pipeline Fix Summary

## Issue
Workflow run #54 (commit c252e46) failed with errors indicating missing binaries for `orbit-client` and `orbit-compute`.

## Root Cause
The `.github/workflows/k8s-container-pipeline.yml` workflow was attempting to build container images for four components:
- `orbit-server` ✅ (has binary target)
- `orbit-client` ❌ (library-only, no binary)
- `orbit-operator` ✅ (has binary target)
- `orbit-compute` ❌ (library-only, no binary)

The workflow's build step at line 250 attempted to build binaries:
```yaml
cargo build $BUILD_FLAGS --target $TARGET --package ${{ matrix.component }} --bin ${{ matrix.component }}
```

This failed for `orbit-client` and `orbit-compute` because they don't have `[[bin]]` sections in their `Cargo.toml` files and don't contain a `src/main.rs` file.

## Solution
Updated `.github/workflows/k8s-container-pipeline.yml` to only build components that have binary targets:

### Changes Made:
1. **Line 156**: Updated build matrix to only include `orbit-server` and `orbit-operator`
   ```yaml
   component: ["orbit-server", "orbit-operator"]
   ```
   
2. **Lines 12-13, 22-23**: Removed `orbit-client` and `orbit-compute` from workflow trigger paths

3. **Lines 162-166**: Updated matrix exclusions to remove references to deleted components

## Verification
- ✅ YAML syntax validated successfully
- ✅ Confirmed package structure:
  - `orbit-client/src/lib.rs` - library only
  - `orbit-compute/src/lib.rs` - library only  
  - `orbit-server/src/main.rs` - has binary
  - `orbit-operator/src/main.rs` - has binary

## Impact
- Workflow will now only attempt to build container images for packages that have actual binary targets
- Reduces unnecessary build attempts and prevents false failures
- Build matrix reduced from 16 combinations to 8 combinations (2 components × 2 platforms × 2 build types)

## Note
The issue title mentioned "Kubernetes Container Pipeline Failed" but the actual problem was a misconfiguration in the build matrix, not a Kubernetes or Podman issue.
