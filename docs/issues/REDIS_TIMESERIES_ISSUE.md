# Redis Time Series Compatibility Implementation

**Feature Type:** Protocol Adapter  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 weeks  
**Phase:** 12  
**Target Release:** Q1 2025  

## Overview

Implement full Redis Time Series (RedisTimeSeries) module compatibility for Orbit-RS, enabling time-series data storage and analysis capabilities through the Redis protocol. This will allow existing applications using RedisTimeSeries to seamlessly migrate to Orbit's distributed actor system.

## Motivation

Time-series databases are critical for IoT applications, financial systems, monitoring, and analytics. By providing Redis Time Series compatibility, Orbit-RS will:

1. **Expand Use Cases**: Support time-series workloads alongside existing Redis and PostgreSQL capabilities
2. **Ease Migration**: Allow seamless migration from existing RedisTimeSeries deployments
3. **Distributed Advantage**: Provide distributed time-series capabilities with Orbit's actor system
4. **Ecosystem Integration**: Work with existing Redis clients and time-series tools

## Technical Requirements

### Core Actor Implementation

#### TimeSeriesActor
```rust

#[async_trait]
pub trait TimeSeriesActor: ActorWithStringKey {
    // Core operations
    async fn add_sample(&self, timestamp: u64, value: f64) -> OrbitResult<u64>;
    async fn get_sample(&self, timestamp: Option<u64>) -> OrbitResult<Option<(u64, f64)>>;
    async fn range_query(&self, from: u64, to: u64, aggregation: Option<Aggregation>) -> OrbitResult<Vec<(u64, f64)>>;
    
    // Metadata operations
    async fn create_series(&self, config: TimeSeriesConfig) -> OrbitResult<()>;
    async fn add_label(&self, key: String, value: String) -> OrbitResult<()>;
    async fn get_info(&self) -> OrbitResult<TimeSeriesInfo>;
    
    // Aggregation rules
    async fn create_rule(&self, dest_key: String, aggregation: Aggregation, bucket_duration: u64) -> OrbitResult<()>;
    async fn delete_rule(&self, dest_key: String) -> OrbitResult<bool>;
}
```

    pub bucket_duration: u64,
    pub alignment_timestamp: Option<u64>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum Aggregation {
    Avg, Sum, Min, Max, Range, Count, Std, Var, First, Last,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
