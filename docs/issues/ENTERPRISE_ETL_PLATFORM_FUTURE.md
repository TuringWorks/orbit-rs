# Enterprise ETL Platform & Connector Ecosystem

**Feature Type:** Platform Integration  
**Priority:** High - Strategic Data Integration Capability  
**Estimated Effort:** 12-15 months  
**Phase:** Strategic Platform Enhancement  
**Target Release:** Q3 2026  

## Overview

Transform Orbit-RS into the **universal data integration hub** by implementing a comprehensive ETL platform and connector ecosystem. This initiative will provide seamless connectivity with 20+ major ETL tools, visual workflow design capabilities, and unified data transformation across all Orbit-RS data models, positioning it as the central nervous system for enterprise data operations.

## Strategic Vision

### The Universal Data Integration Hub

Orbit-RS will become the first platform to unify:
- **Multi-Model Database** (relational, graph, vector, time series)
- **Enterprise ETL Platform** (visual designer, workflow orchestration)  
- **Universal Connectors** (20+ major ETL tools and platforms)
- **Real-Time Processing** (streaming and batch data integration)
- **Enterprise Governance** (data lineage, quality, compliance)
