# Unified Multi-Model Query Language - Feature Backlog

## 📋 Epic Overview

**Epic ID**: ORBIT-020  
**Epic Title**: SurrealQL-Compatible Unified Multi-Model Query Language  
**Priority**: 🔥 Critical  
**Phase**: Q2 2025  
**Total Effort**: 16-20 weeks  
**Status**: Planned  

## 🎯 Epic Description

Implement a unified query language (OrbitQL) that combines document, graph, time-series, and key-value operations in a single query, inspired by SurrealQL but optimized for distributed actor systems. This will be our primary competitive differentiator against traditional multi-model databases.

## 📈 Business Value

### Primary Benefits
- **Developer Experience**: Single language for all data models eliminates cognitive overhead
- **Query Efficiency**: Cross-model joins and operations in one query execution
- **Market Differentiation**: First distributed database with true multi-model query unification
- **Cost Reduction**: Simplified application architecture reduces development and maintenance costs

### Target Use Cases
1. **Real-time Dashboards**: Combine metrics, relationships, and documents
2. **IoT Analytics**: Time-series data with device relationships and metadata
3. **Social Platforms**: User data, connections, content, and activity metrics
4. **E-commerce**: Products, relationships, reviews, and transaction history
5. **Financial Services**: Transactions, relationships, compliance data, and time-series

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Core Components

```rust
// Unified Query Engine
pub struct OrbitQLEngine {
    pub document_engine: DocumentQueryEngine,
    pub graph_engine: GraphQueryEngine,
    pub timeseries_engine: TimeSeriesQueryEngine,
    pub keyvalue_engine: KeyValueQueryEngine,
    pub optimizer: MultiModelOptimizer,
}

pub trait OrbitQLActor: ActorWithStringKey {
    // Unified query execution
    async fn execute_orbitql(&self, query: String, params: QueryParams) -> OrbitResult<QueryResult>;
    async fn explain_query(&self, query: String) -> OrbitResult<QueryPlan>;
    async fn stream_query(&self, query: String, params: QueryParams) -> OrbitResult<QueryStream>;
    
    // Transaction support across models
    async fn begin_multi_model_transaction(&self) -> OrbitResult<TransactionId>;
    async fn commit_transaction(&self, tx_id: TransactionId) -> OrbitResult<()>;
    async fn rollback_transaction(&self, tx_id: TransactionId) -> OrbitResult<()>;
}
```

### Query Language Syntax

#### Cross-Model Operations
```sql
-- Document + Graph + TimeSeries in single query
SELECT 
    user.name,
    user.profile.* AS profile,
    ->follows->user.name AS friends,
    <-likes<-post.title AS liked_posts,
    metrics[cpu_usage WHERE timestamp > time::now() - 1h] AS recent_cpu
FROM users AS user
WHERE user.active = true AND user.age > 18
RELATE user->viewed->product SET timestamp = time::now()
FETCH friends, liked_posts, recent_cpu;
```

#### Time-Series Integration
```sql
-- Combine user data with their activity metrics
SELECT 
    user.*,
    time_series.page_views[
        WHERE timestamp BETWEEN $start AND $end
        GROUP BY time::group(timestamp, '1h')
        AGGREGATE sum(value) AS hourly_views
    ] AS activity
FROM users user
JOIN time_series ON user.id = time_series.user_id
WHERE user.subscription = 'premium';
```

#### Graph Traversals with Documents
```sql
-- Find influencers and their content performance
FOR user IN users
    FILTER user.followers_count > 1000
    FOR post IN OUTBOUND user posts
        FILTER post.created_at > date_sub(now(), 30, 'day')
        COLLECT user_name = user.name INTO posts
        RETURN {
            influencer: user_name,
            post_count: length(posts),
            avg_engagement: avg(posts[*].post.engagement_rate)
        }
```
