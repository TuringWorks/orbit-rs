## Project Organization

All 15 issues have been:
- ✅ Added to the GitHub project board
- ✅ Assigned appropriate phase labels
- ✅ Assigned to their respective milestones
- ✅ Organized by priority and dependencies

## Current Status

**Phase 8:** ✅ COMPLETE - Comprehensive SQL Query Engine with PostgreSQL compatibility, vector operations, and advanced features

**Next Steps:** The GitHub project now provides a structured way to track and manage development progress through Phases 9-11, with clear deliverables, timelines, and success criteria for each feature.

## Total Development Estimate

- **Phase 9:** 19-25 weeks (Query Optimization & Performance)
- **Phase 10:** 21-29 weeks (Production Readiness)  
- **Phase 11:** 25-31 weeks (Advanced Features)

**Combined Total:** 65-85 weeks of development effort across all three phases.

The roadmap provides a comprehensive path from the current production-ready SQL engine to a fully-featured, enterprise-grade distributed actor system with advanced database capabilities.
