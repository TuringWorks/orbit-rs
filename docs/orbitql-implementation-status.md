## ðŸ§ª **WORKING EXAMPLES**

The implementation now supports real-world OrbitQL queries:

### Document Queries
```orbitql
SELECT name, email, profile.location 
FROM users 
WHERE active = true AND age > 25
ORDER BY name
LIMIT 10;
```

### Graph Traversal
```orbitql
SELECT from, to, relationship
FROM follows
WHERE relationship = 'follows'
```

### Time-Series Analysis  
```orbitql
SELECT timestamp, value, tags
FROM metrics
WHERE timestamp > time::now() - 3h
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### Multi-Model Joins
```orbitql
SELECT u.name, f.to AS friend_id, m.value AS metric_value
FROM users u
JOIN follows f ON u.id = f.from  
LEFT JOIN metrics m ON u.id = m.tags.user_id
WHERE u.active = true;
```

### Complex Analytics
```orbitql
SELECT 
    u.name,
    u.profile.location,
    COUNT(f.to) as friend_count,
    AVG(m.value) AS avg_metric
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN follows f ON u.id = f.from
LEFT JOIN metrics m ON u.id = m.tags.user_id
WHERE u.active = true AND m.timestamp > time::now() - 24h
GROUP BY u.id, u.name, u.profile.location
ORDER BY friend_count DESC, avg_metric DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
