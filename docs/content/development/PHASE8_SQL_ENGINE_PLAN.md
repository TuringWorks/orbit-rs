## Phase 8: SQL Query Engine Implementation Plan

## Overview - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

**Phase 8 is COMPLETE and significantly exceeded original scope!**

Phase 8 originally planned to implement core DML operations, but the actual implementation includes a **comprehensive SQL query engine** that goes far beyond the original plan:

### COMPLETED - Far Beyond Original Scope

- Complete SQL lexer with all PostgreSQL tokens including vector operators
- Comprehensive AST for all SQL constructs (DDL, DML, DCL, TCL, utility)
- Full expression parser with proper operator precedence and vector operations
- **ALL DML operations**: SELECT (with JOINs, subqueries, CTEs, window functions), INSERT (with RETURNING, ON CONFLICT), UPDATE (with JOINs, RETURNING), DELETE (with USING, RETURNING)
- **Complete DDL support**: CREATE/ALTER/DROP for tables, indexes, views, schemas, extensions
- **DCL/TCL support**: GRANT/REVOKE, transaction control (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK/SAVEPOINT)
- **SQL Executor framework** with modular DDL and DML executors
- **pgvector compatibility** with vector distance operators (<->, <#>, <=>)
- **Comprehensive test suite** with extensive SQL parsing and execution tests
- **PostgreSQL wire protocol integration** ready for production use

**Current Status**: Implementation is equivalent to completing Phases 8-10 combined!

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. SELECT Statement Implementation

#### Priority: HIGH (Foundation for all other operations)

**Components:**

- SELECT clause parsing (column projection)
- FROM clause parsing (table references)
- WHERE clause integration (using existing expression parser)
- ORDER BY clause parsing
- LIMIT/OFFSET clause parsing
- Basic JOIN support (INNER JOIN initially)

**Files to create/modify:**

- `orbit-protocols/src/postgres_wire/sql/parser/select.rs`
- `orbit-protocols/src/postgres_wire/sql/executor/select.rs`

**AST Extensions needed:**

```rust
pub struct SelectStatement {
    pub select_list: Vec<SelectItem>,
    pub from_clause: Option<FromClause>,
    pub where_clause: Option<Expression>,
    pub order_by: Vec<OrderByExpression>,
    pub limit: Option<LimitClause>,
}

pub enum SelectItem {
    Wildcard,
    Expression { expr: Expression, alias: Option<String> },
}

pub struct FromClause {
    pub table_name: String,
    pub alias: Option<String>,
    pub joins: Vec<JoinClause>,
}
```

### 2. INSERT Statement Implementation

#### Priority: HIGH (Basic data modification)

**Components:**

- INSERT INTO parsing
- VALUES clause parsing
- Column list specification
- Type validation and conversion
- Batch insert support
- RETURNING clause support

**Files to create/modify:**

- `orbit-protocols/src/postgres_wire/sql/parser/insert.rs`
- `orbit-protocols/src/postgres_wire/sql/executor/insert.rs`

**AST Extensions:**

```rust
pub struct InsertStatement {
    pub table_name: String,
    pub columns: Option<Vec<String>>,
    pub values: InsertValues,
    pub returning: Option<Vec<SelectItem>>,
}

pub enum InsertValues {
    Values(Vec<Vec<Expression>>),
    Select(Box<SelectStatement>),
}
```

### 3. UPDATE Statement Implementation

#### Priority: MEDIUM (Data modification with conditions)

**Components:**

- UPDATE clause parsing
- SET clause parsing (column = expression pairs)
- WHERE clause integration
- JOIN support in UPDATE
- RETURNING clause support

**Files to create/modify:**

- `orbit-protocols/src/postgres_wire/sql/parser/update.rs`
- `orbit-protocols/src/postgres_wire/sql/executor/update.rs`

**AST Extensions:**

```rust
pub struct UpdateStatement {
    pub table_name: String,
    pub set_clauses: Vec<SetClause>,
    pub from_clause: Option<FromClause>,
    pub where_clause: Option<Expression>,
    pub returning: Option<Vec<SelectItem>>,
}

pub struct SetClause {
    pub column: String,
    pub value: Expression,
}
```

### 4. DELETE Statement Implementation

#### Priority: MEDIUM (Data deletion with conditions)

**Components:**

- DELETE FROM parsing
- WHERE clause integration
- JOIN support in DELETE
- RETURNING clause support

**Files to create/modify:**

- `orbit-protocols/src/postgres_wire/sql/parser/delete.rs`
- `orbit-protocols/src/postgres_wire/sql/executor/delete.rs`

**AST Extensions:**

```rust
pub struct DeleteStatement {
    pub table_name: String,
    pub where_clause: Option<Expression>,
    pub returning: Option<Vec<SelectItem>>,
}
```

## Query Executor Architecture

### Data Storage Interface

```rust
pub trait DataStorage {
    async fn create_table(&self, table: &TableDefinition) -> Result<(), StorageError>;
    async fn select(&self, query: &SelectQuery) -> Result<QueryResult, StorageError>;
    async fn insert(&self, table: &str, rows: Vec<Row>) -> Result<InsertResult, StorageError>;
    async fn update(&self, query: &UpdateQuery) -> Result<UpdateResult, StorageError>;
    async fn delete(&self, query: &DeleteQuery) -> Result<DeleteResult, StorageError>;
}

pub struct QueryResult {
    pub columns: Vec<ColumnInfo>,
    pub rows: Vec<Row>,
    pub row_count: usize,
}

pub struct Row {
    pub values: Vec<SqlValue>,
}
```

### Actor Integration Strategy

1. **Table Actor Mapping**: Each SQL table maps to an Orbit actor type
2. **Collection Actors**: Manage collections of data with CRUD operations
3. **Query Coordination**: Distribute queries across multiple actors when needed
4. **Transaction Integration**: Use existing transaction system for ACID compliance
