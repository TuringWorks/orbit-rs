## Usage Patterns

### Building a Knowledge Graph

1. First, build the knowledge graph from documents:
```redis
GRAPHRAG.BUILD my_kg doc1 "Your document content here..."
GRAPHRAG.BUILD my_kg doc2 "More document content..."
```

2. Check statistics:
```redis
GRAPHRAG.STATS my_kg
```

### Querying with RAG

1. Execute natural language queries:
```redis
GRAPHRAG.QUERY my_kg "What are the main relationships in the data?" INCLUDE_EXPLANATION
```

2. Find specific connections:
```redis
GRAPHRAG.REASON my_kg "Entity A" "Entity B" MAX_HOPS 3
```

### Entity Analysis

1. List entities by type:
```redis
GRAPHRAG.ENTITIES my_kg ENTITY_TYPE person LIMIT 20
```

2. Find similar entities:
```redis
GRAPHRAG.SIMILAR my_kg "Important Entity" THRESHOLD 0.7
```

## Performance Notes

- **Document Processing**: Entity extraction and graph construction are computationally intensive
- **RAG Queries**: Combine graph traversal, vector search, and LLM generation - expect higher latency
- **Caching**: Results are cached where possible to improve performance
- **Batch Processing**: Consider processing multiple documents before querying for better efficiency

## Error Handling

All GraphRAG commands return detailed error messages for common issues:

- Invalid knowledge graph names
- Malformed query text
- Missing required parameters
- Processing timeouts
- Resource limitations

Check the response for error messages and adjust parameters accordingly.

## Integration Examples

### Python (using redis-py)

```python
import redis

# Connect to Orbit-RS RESP server
client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)

# Build knowledge graph
result = client.execute_command(
    'GRAPHRAG.BUILD', 'my_kg', 'doc1', 
    'Apple Inc. is a technology company founded by Steve Jobs.'
)
print(f"Entities extracted: {result[1]}")

# Query the graph
response = client.execute_command(
    'GRAPHRAG.QUERY', 'my_kg', 
    'Tell me about Apple Inc.',
    'INCLUDE_EXPLANATION'
)
print(f"Response: {response[1]}")
```

### Node.js (using ioredis)

```javascript
const Redis = require('ioredis');
const client = new Redis();

// Build knowledge graph
const buildResult = await client.call(
    'GRAPHRAG.BUILD', 'my_kg', 'doc1',
    'Microsoft Corporation is a technology company.'
);
console.log(`Relationships extracted: ${buildResult[3]}`);

// Query with reasoning
const queryResult = await client.call(
    'GRAPHRAG.QUERY', 'my_kg',
    'What companies are mentioned?',
    'MAX_HOPS', 2
);
console.log(`Query response: ${queryResult[1]}`);
```

This comprehensive GraphRAG implementation provides powerful knowledge graph construction and querying capabilities through familiar Redis-compatible commands.
