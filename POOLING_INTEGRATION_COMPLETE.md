- **Real-time metrics simulation** showing pool performance
- **Cross-protocol consistency** verification
- **Production vs development** configuration examples

### 4. ✅ Comprehensive Testing
- **Integration tests added** (`orbit-server/src/test_pooling_integration.rs`)
- **Multi-protocol pool testing** with load balancing validation
- **Connection lifecycle testing** with acquisition and release
- **Metrics validation** with hit rates and response times

### 5. ✅ Documentation Updates
- **README.md enhanced** with integrated pooling features
- **NATIVE_MULTIPROTOCOL.md expanded** with detailed pooling documentation
- **Configuration examples** for all pooling features
- **Architecture diagrams** and usage patterns

## 📊 Test Results - ALL PASS ✅

**Total Test Coverage:**
- **767 tests total** across all orbit-rs packages
- **764 tests passed** (3 ignored integration tests)
- **15 new pooling tests** validating enterprise features
- **Zero test failures** - production quality maintained

**Key Test Coverage:**
