## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: [security@turingworks.com](mailto:security@turingworks.com)
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested remediation (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Status Updates**: Every 5-7 days during investigation
- **Resolution Timeline**: 
  - Critical vulnerabilities: 7-14 days
  - High severity: 14-30 days
  - Medium/Low severity: 30-90 days

### After Reporting

- **Accepted Vulnerabilities**: 
  - We will work with you to understand and reproduce the issue
  - You will be credited in the security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)
  - We will coordinate disclosure timeline with you
  - A CVE will be requested for significant vulnerabilities

- **Declined Reports**:
  - We will explain why the report was declined

## Security Best Practices

When deploying Orbit-RS:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update to latest stable versions
2. **Enable TLS**: Use encrypted communication for production deployments
3. **Restrict Access**: Use network policies and RBAC to limit access
4. **Monitor Logs**: Enable audit logging and monitor for suspicious activity
5. **Use Secrets Management**: Never hardcode credentials in configuration files
6. **Regular Security Audits**: Run security scans as part of your CI/CD pipeline
