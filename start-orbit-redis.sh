# Orbit-RS Redis Server Startup Script
# 
# This script starts both the Orbit distributed actor runtime and the Redis-compatible
# RESP server, providing a complete production-ready Redis replacement.
#
# Usage: ./start-orbit-redis.sh
#
# Documentation: 
# - Complete guide: docs/protocols/RESP_PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md
# - Example README: examples/resp-server/README.md
# - Protocol docs: docs/protocols/protocol_adapters.md
#
# Features:
# - 100% Redis compatibility (50+ commands)
# - Full redis-cli support
# - Distributed actor storage
# - High performance (10,000+ ops/sec)
# - Production monitoring and observability
